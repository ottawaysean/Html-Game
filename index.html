			<p id = "mainInstructions">Oh No! Insectoid space invaders have blown up your fuel cargo ship. It's now up to you to retrieve fuel from the fuel cell floating in orbit. 
			Careful though, if one of the Insectoid ships catches you, they'll steal your fuel! 
			1 enemy ship is randomly chosen to be an attacker and another is randomly chosen to be a fuel station attacker, if the attacker or station attacker ship catches you, you will take damage or your cargo station will take damage. 
			When you've collected fuel from the cell, head back to the fuel station to store the fuel, this adds to your score. You have 60 seconds to collect as much fuel as you can! 
			If you save 2,500 units of fuel within 60 seconds, the attackers will be displayed on your radar and you will also get a bonus 60 seconds on your time. 
			If you save 10,000 units of fuel, your health will be restored. If a player can rack up 30,000 units of fuel, they will be rewarded. Good Luck and watch your HUD and Radar...
			</p>
			<p id = "hudInstructions">Keep any eye on your hud. If your health drops below 50%, your ship will generate an error code. If your pilot knows how to repair that code, he will perform a repair worth up to 50% of health!
			But be careful, he can only make a repair once.
